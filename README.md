### <samp>Hey, there! ðŸ‘‹ </samp>

<samp>I'm a Full Stack JavaScript Developer from Morocco ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¦ highly motivated, dynamic, persevering, rigorous. I am passionate about Web Development, blockchain and open source. ðŸ¤— Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborate on any Open Source project which I consider interesting or useful.</samp>
  
<samp> ðŸ“’ I try to post as frequently as I can (crossposting to [dev.to](https://dev.to/getspooky)). Everything I post is tech related and about things I find interesting to explain or to make others know about it.</samp>
