<b>Hi there, I'm Yasser!</b> ğŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack JavaScript Developer from Morocco ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¦ who is passionate about Web Development, blockchain and open source.
ğŸ¤— Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborate on any Open Source project which I consider interesting or useful.

ğŸ“’ I try to post as frequently as I can (crossposting to [dev.to](https://dev.to/getspooky)). Everything I post is tech related and about things I find interesting to explain or to make others know about it.
